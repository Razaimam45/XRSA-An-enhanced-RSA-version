# XRSA-An-enhanced-RSA-version

**Abstract** Cryptography is the mechanism of providing 
signifcant security services such as confdentiality, authentication, and integrity. These services are essentially more 
important in the current era, where lots of IoT devices are 
generating data and being stored in the cloud environment. 
Public key cryptography is highly efective in achieving confdentiality and authentication services. One of the popular 
public-key cryptography schemes is the RSA algorithm, 
which besides other concepts uses two very large prime integers. In the proposed study, the authors enhanced the RSA 
algorithm in the context of generation of a more complex 
key pair, i.e., public and private key, so that adversary should 
never be able to determine the private key using public-key. 
The proposed scheme uses four random large prime numbers to generate public–private key pairs and applies XOR 
operation along with the more complex intermediate process in key-generation encryption and decryption phases to 
achieve higher algorithm complexity, which would require 
more time to break the proposed cipher and would make it 
extremely difcult for third-parties to attack, hence boosting security. The method is also compared with other RSA-based algorithms to demonstrate the potency of the proposed algorithm in terms of enhanced performance and security.
